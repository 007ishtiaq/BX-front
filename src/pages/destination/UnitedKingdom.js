                    designed as an alternative route for students to bridge the

                    Obtaining a student visa is generally straightforward.
                    Applicants from Pakistan must provide a Confirmation of
                    Acceptance for Studies (CAS) from a UK university and
                    evidence of financial support for tuition and living costs.
                    Dedicated visa counselors assist with the process. The visa
                    typically covers the entire course duration and permits
                    multiple entries. <br />
                    <span> Employment Opportunities</span> Students at

                    week during term time and full-time during vacations. This
